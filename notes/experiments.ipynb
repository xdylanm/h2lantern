    "## Experiment 1 - H2 Production from NaOH\n",
    "\n",
    "17-09-2022\n",
    "\n",
    "### Materials\n",
    "* Balloon\n",
    "    * mass: 10g\n",
    "    * diameter (uninflated): 440mm \n",
    "    * approximate volume: 10L\n",
    "* NaOH: 11g\n",
    "* Al foil: 8g\n",
    "\n",
    "Expecting loss in H2, double amounts of NaOH & Al.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "The procedure is outlined in NightHawkInLight's video [How to Make Hydrogen Gas - Clean Burning, Inexpensive, Lighter than Air!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-HkVlq1kcQ). The chemistry reference is [here](https://www.chemistryscl.com/reactions/aluminum+NaOH%20reaction/index.php)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fill water jug (bubbler) with water; leave 3cm air at top\n",
    "* Fill flask with 500mL warm water\n",
    "* Add 22g NaOH and disolve\n",
    "* Add 1-2g crumpled sheets of Al \n",
    "* Collect gas in balloon\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "* With 2x NaOH mass, there was sufficient H2 production to also partially inflate a small grocery bag (a few L)\n",
    "    * the reaction was slowing substantially towards the end, estimate 1.5x mass required next time\n",
    "* Approximate rate of production was 10L in 45 minutes\n",
    "* Add 1-2g of Al at a time and monitor temperature (reaction is exothermic)\n",
    "    * adding Al requires removing the stopper from the flask, which likely mixes air in with the H2\n",
    "* Filled balloon (10g) was buoyant with 10cm attached string using approximately 10L of H2 (10L should give 12g lift)\n",
    "    * balloon filled to taught (lightly pressurized) lost some gas within a few minutes of disconnecting the feed and would yield easily when poked\n",
    "    * filled balloon has dimensions of approximately 32cm diameter and 12.5cm height (approx 10L -- it's not a perfect cylinder)\n"
